## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 **Eco-Verification System**

Our AI-powered 3-step verification process ensures every eco-claim is legitimate. When a seller uploads a new product, our platform begins a comprehensive eco-verification process:

- **Step 1:** Seller provides at least one product image along with basic details like name, category, and price
- **Step 2:** Seller fills in eco-specific fields such as the eco label (e.g., Organic, Recycled) and a description explaining why the product is eco-friendly
- **Step 3:** By clicking the "Verify Eco Status" button, the system checks both the image and description using AI to determine if the product deserves an "Eco Verified" badge

If verified, the badge appears along with a confidence percentage (e.g., "Verified – 87% Confidence") to give buyers transparency. If the product doesn't qualify, a warning is shown instead, clearly stating the reason why the claim was not verified.

![Eco Verified Badge](./assets/eco-verify-badge.png)

### 🏪 **Seller Verification Process**

To maintain credibility in eco-commerce, every seller must go through a rigorous verification process before listing any products:

1. **Registration:** First, the seller registers on the platform by providing basic details such as shop name, email, password, and contact number
2. **Documentation:** Second, to request verification, the seller must submit key business information — including shop photos, purchase bills, sourcing details, brand association documents, and eco-related certifications
3. **Admin Review:** Third, this verification request is automatically forwarded to the admin panel. The admin carefully reviews the submitted data and either approves or rejects the seller
4. **Approval:** Only after successful verification is the seller allowed to list products and use eco-labels, ensuring that only authentic sellers are visible to customers

![Admin Verification Panel](./assets/admin-pending-ver.png)

### 📊 **Personal Eco Impact Dashboard**

Each user has a personal dashboard that displays how much CO₂ they've saved through eco-verified purchases and grouped deliveries. This feature gives users a real sense of their contribution to the environment, turning abstract eco-goals into measurable impact.

Users can view a detailed list of their past purchases that were verified as eco-friendly. This not only builds trust by providing transparency, but also motivates customers to continue shopping sustainably and track their progress over time.

![Eco Purchase History](./assets/co2-dash.png)

### 🚚 **Smart Group Delivery System**

Our platform identifies customers in the same area who have ordered eco-verified products within a similar timeframe. It then suggests combining those orders into a single delivery. This reduces the number of delivery trips, cuts down packaging waste, and significantly lowers last-mile carbon emissions — making sustainable shopping even more impactful.

![Delivery Optimization](./assets/group-del.png)

### ⚠️ **Real-Time Purchase Validation**

Before completing a purchase, the system re-checks whether the product is eco-verified. If not, a warning message appears during the add-to-cart or checkout stage, alerting the customer that the eco-claim is not yet verified. This real-time validation ensures that users are always informed before making a final purchase decision, reducing trust issues and potential returns.

If a seller marks a product as eco-friendly but the verification fails, the website displays a clear warning on the product card and details page. This warning informs users that the product has not been verified and may not meet genuine eco-standards.

![Warning System](./assets/prod-ver.png)

### 🏆 **Eco Buyer Rewards System**

To encourage eco-conscious behavior, users earn reward points for verified eco-purchases and group deliveries. These points help unlock eco-badges and levels — like "Eco-Champion" — adding a gamified layer that makes sustainability engaging and rewarding.
